## General

The purpose of the proposal is to demonstrate that you've thought about and planned how you will finish your Core and Reach. Your proposals will also let us know how we can help you.

It is quite common for your Reach to change after submitting the Proposal and before the Reach is graded. You do not need to notify us if you do. We will grade your Reach based on what you actually submit, as described in the Reach part of the spec. If you have any questions about changing your Reach, please ask on Piazza or in Office Hours.

#### Major Tasks
Review the project specs with your partners and determine your work distribution for Core and Reach. Although you may not be able to access the project files yet, the [Core specs](Core#core-structure) detail which functions and files you will have to write to complete your assignment. We recommend that one half of the team implements ```LanguageModel.py``` and ```generate.py``` while the other half implements the guts of the learning models.

## Format

Your proposal submission should be named:

```
proposal.pdf
```

With this format:

```
- Team Name
- group member 1; uniqname 1
- group member 2; uniqname 2
- group member 3; uniqname 3
- group member 4; uniqname 4

1. A description of your Reach (Application and Showmanship)

2. Work distribution plan for the core

3. Work distribution plan for the reach

4. Where and when you plan to meet
```

## Sample Proposal
- The Beatles
- John Lennon; jlennon
- Paul McCartney; mccartney
- George Harrison; hairygeorge
- Ringo Starr; ringstarrrrr

1. We will use our models to create polka (Application) and use matplotlib to graph the songs we've created (Showmanship). We intend to use songs from Taylor Swift, perhaps the greatest international artist of all time, maybe all history.

2. For the Core, John and Paul will implement languageModel.py, while George and Ringo will implement unigramModel.py, bigramModel.py, and trigramModel.py. We will then get together to implement generate.py, and then test our functions together.

3. For the Reach, John and Paul will focus on refining our polka model, while George and Ringo will implement the matplotlib display.

4. We plan to meet in the Ugli basement on Sundays and Fridays from 2AM to 6AM.
