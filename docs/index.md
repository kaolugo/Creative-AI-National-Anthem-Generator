# Creative AI Project Spec

**Creative AI** is an artificial intelligence project about using computers to create art. Using Python you will build learning models that can create a variety of works, from lyrics to poems to blues to jazz. We'll start by teaching you how to build learning models for Beatles' song lyrics and video game music. Then we'll give you the freedom to create your own Creative AI.

### Project Overview

1. [Proposal](./Proposal-Details)
2. [Warmup](./Warmup)
3. [Core](./Core)
4. [Reach](./Reach)
5. [Grading and Key Dates](./Grading-Policy-and-Dates)
6. Appendices: [Testing](./Testing), [Concepts](./Concepts), [Advanced Concepts](./Advanced-Concepts)

**Before you start to code ANYTHING, please read and follow the [Project Installation Instructions and Python 3 Setup Guide](./Python-3)**

There are three parts to this project: the [warmup](./Warmup), the [core](./Core), and the [reach](./Reach). Each need to be completed and pushed with a working solution to your teams GitHub Repository for credit (yes, that includes the Warmup). 

1. In the warmup, you will complete a tutorial to get comfortable with the Python you will need to complete the project. No prior Python experience needed.

2. For the core, you will build a model that learns the structure of Beatles' song lyrics to generate similar songs. Then, we will teach you how to extend this model to generate music based on video game music. To write this learning model, you will draw on methods from a field of AI called [natural language processing](./Terminology-and-Definitions#natural-language-processing) (NLP).

3. For the reach, you will extend your learning model even further on a genre of your choice. First you'll pick an application, the genre for your Creative AI. Then you'll come up with your own heuristics to make your learning model better and better. Finally you'll find a way to showcase your AI so that even non-programmers can understand it. Your Final Project will be uniquely yours, your creativity as expressed in programming.

If you're curious, we created demo videos for sample <a href="https://youtu.be/Z46LvHwgygs?list=PL2BYDiR6uDOJzYCJ7QuuQz-hWvQeYN5Nx" target="_blank">generated lyrics</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/RrHrRqZ3pUM?list=PL2BYDiR6uDOJzYCJ7QuuQz-hWvQeYN5Nx" target="_blank">generated music</a> using our implementation of the project.

Because this project teaches a variety of concepts and Python constructs, you should read the entire spec before beginning to code. You should also complete the Warmup before beginning the Core. Everyone is expected to complete the Warmup, even though we will only grade it once per team. 

**Note: Be sure that you are using Python 3.X for this project. The distribution code is not compatible with Python 2.**
