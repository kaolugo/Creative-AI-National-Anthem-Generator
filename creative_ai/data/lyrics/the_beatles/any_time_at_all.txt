Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there

If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right
If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really sympathise
Don't you be sad
Just call me tonight

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there

If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine
There is nothing I won't do
When you need a shoulder to cry on
I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight and I'll come to you

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there

Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there
