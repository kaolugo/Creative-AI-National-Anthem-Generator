Lucille, 
Baby do your sister's will. 
Lucille, 
Baby do your sister's will. 
Well you went up and married 
But I love you still. 

Lucille, 
Baby satisfy my soul. 
Lucille, 
Baby satisfy my soul. 
Well you know I love baby, 
I'll never let you go. 

Well I woke up this morning, 
Lucille was not inside. 
I asked her friends about her, 
But all their lips were tight. 

Lucille, 
Please come back where you belong. 
Well I'm talking to you baby, 
I'll never put you on. 

Well Lucille, 
Baby do your sister's will. 
Oo Lucille, 
Yeah baby do your sister's will. 
Well you went up and married 
But I love you still.
