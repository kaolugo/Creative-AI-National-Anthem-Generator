Let me take you down 
cause I'm going to strawberry fields 
Nothing is real 
and nothing to get hung about 
Strawberry fields forever 

Living is easy with eyes closed 
Misunderstanding all you see 
It's getting hard to be someone 
but it all works out 
It doesn't matter much to me 

Let me take you down 
cause I'm going to strawberry fields 
Nothing is real 
and nothing to get hung about 
Strawberry fields forever 

No one I think is in my tree 
I mean it must be high or low 
That is you can't, you know, tune in 
but it's all right 
That is I think it's not too bad 

Let me take you down 
cause I'm going to strawberry fields 
Nothing is real 
and nothing to get hung about 
Strawberry fields forever 

Always know sometimes think it's me 
But you know I know when it's a dream 
I think I know I mean, ah yes 
but it's all wrong 
that is I think I disagree 

Let me take you down 
cause I'm going to strawberry fields 
Nothing is real 
and nothing to get hung about 
Strawberry fields forever 
Strawberry fields forever 
strawberry fields forever
