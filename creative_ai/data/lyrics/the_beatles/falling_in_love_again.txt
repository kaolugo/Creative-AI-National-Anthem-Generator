Falling in love again, for the love we share
As you hear me say "I adore you."

I'm falling in love again, oh, my darling, it seems
All my darling it seems, I love you.

All our romances would never go astray
My love is your love, forever and a day

Falling in love again, paradise right here
I love that you're my dear, I love you.

(Instrumental break)

Falling in love again, for the love we share
As you hear me say "I adore you."

Falling in love again, paradise right here
I love that you're my dear, I love you.
