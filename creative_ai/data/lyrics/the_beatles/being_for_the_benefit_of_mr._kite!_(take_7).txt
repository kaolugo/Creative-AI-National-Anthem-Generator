(Take 7)
(OK man, let's go, the light's on

1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline

The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair, what a scene!

Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. Kite will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. Kite
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate

The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flys through the ring don't be late

Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. Kite performs his tricks without a sound

And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground

Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
