I saw her standing on the corner
A yellow ribbon in her hair
I couldn't stop myself from shoutin'
Look-a there, Look-a there
Look-a there, Look-a there

Young blood
Young blood
Young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

I took one look and I was captured
I tried to walk but I was lame
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?

Young blood
Young blood
Young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

What crazy stuff, she looked so tough
I tried to follow her all the way home
But things went bad, I met her dad
He said "You better leave my daughter alone"

I couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'
I saw the rising of the sun
And all along my heart was cryin'
You're the one, You're the one
You're the one, You're the one

Young blood
Young blood
Young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

Young blood
Young blood
Young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
