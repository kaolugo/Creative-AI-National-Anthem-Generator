If you let me take your heart
I will prove to you
We will never be apart
If I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me

Big and black the clouds may be
Time will pass away
If you put your trust in me
I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now
Tell me what you see
Don't you realise now?
What you see is me

Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time
How can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm
Tryin' to get to you?
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me

Tell me what you see

Listen to me one more time
How can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm
Tryin' to get to you?
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me
