Ain't no doubt about it, 
This must be love. 
One little kiss from you 
And I feel glad all over. 
Oo baby I don't (...) 
It's silly, 
But I'm glad all over. 

Yeah the goosepimples baby. 
'cos I feel so good 
When you call me like you do. 
And I feel glad all over. 
Oo mercy, I'm doggone (...) 
And I'm happy 
And I'm glad all over. 

Your touch sewed me 
Like an electric wire. 
And make love 
It don't take much luck 
To see what I've got. 
But it shows, yes it shows. 
Come on honey Bonnie, 
Give me one more time. 
Everytime you do 
Well I feel glad all over. 
Oo baby, I don't (...) 
It's silly 
But I'm glad all over. 

Tried to tell you 
How I'm cooking inside 
When we're cheek to cheek. 
My temperature is low, 
Fever is high, 
I can't speak, 
I'm too weak. 

Well come on honey Bonnie, 
Give me one more time. 
Everytime you do 
Well I feel glad all over. 
Oo baby, I don't (...) 
It's silly 
But I'm glad all over. 
Oo baby, I don't (...) 
It's silly 
But I'm glad all over. 
Oo baby, I don't (...) 
It's silly 
But I'm glad all over.
