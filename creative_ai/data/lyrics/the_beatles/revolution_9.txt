Bottle of claret for you if I'd realised.
Well, do next time.
I'd forgotten all about it, George, so I'm sorry.  Will you forgive me?
Yes.
Cheeky bitch.

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number

Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Every one of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen times
Your fibres giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

Number 9, number 9

Who's to know?
Who was to know?

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9

I sustained nothing worse than
Also spoken for
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

Number 9, number 9, number 9

Right, right
Right, right, right, right
Right, right

9, number 9, number 9, number 9

I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rouge doctors have brought this specimen

I have nobody's short-cuts, aha

9, number 9

With the situation

They are standing still

The plan, the telegram

Ooh ooh

Number 9, number

Ooh

A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Who could tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive was high
And his eyes were low

All right!

Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9

So the wife called, and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it
Right!
Yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the bloody Navy and went to sea

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I am not in the mood for wearing

Um da
Aaah

How?
The dogs were dogging, the cats were catting
The birds were birding, and the fish were fishing
The men were themming, and the when were whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

Number 9, number 9, number 9, 
Number 9, number 9, number 9

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El Dorado

Take this, brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's not that; it's
What? What? Oh

Maybe even then
Exposures in London
It's a difficulty being
By exposure
Because it's almost like being naked

If you become naked

That line
Hold that line
Hold that line
Hold that line
Hold that line

Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
Block that kick
