Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle

Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont trs bien ensemble
Trs bien ensemble

I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand

Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont trs bien ensemble
Trs bien ensemble

I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you

I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you so you'll understand

Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont trs bien ensemble
Trs bien ensemble
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle
