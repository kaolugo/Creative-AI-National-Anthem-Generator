It's been a long time 
Now I'm coming back home 
I've been away now 
Oh, how I've been alone 

Wait
Till I come back to your side 
We'll forget the tears we cried 

But if your heart breaks 
Don't wait
Turn me away 
And if your heart's strong 
Hold on
I won't delay 

Wait
Till I come back to your side 
We'll forget the tears we cried 

I feel as though 
You ought to know 
That I've been good 
As good as I can be 
And if you do 
I'll trust in you 
And know that you 
Will wait for me 

It's been a long time 
Now I'm coming back home 
I've been away now 
Oh, how I've been alone 

Wait
Till I come back to your side 
We'll forget the tears we cried 

I feel as though 
You ought to know 
That I've been good 
As good as I can be 
And if you do 
I'll trust in you 
And know that you 
Will wait for me 

But if your heart breaks 
Don't wait
Turn me away 
And if your heart's strong 
Hold on
I won't delay 

Wait
Till I come back to your side 
We'll forget the tears we cried 

It's been a long time 
Now I'm coming back home 
I've been away now 
Oh, how I've been alone
