You don't realise how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you

Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?

I didn't realise
As I looked in your eyes
You told me

Oh, yes, you told me
You don't want my lovin' any more
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on any more

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you

So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you

But when you told me
You don't want my lovin' any more
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on any more

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you

So, come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you
I need you

I need you
