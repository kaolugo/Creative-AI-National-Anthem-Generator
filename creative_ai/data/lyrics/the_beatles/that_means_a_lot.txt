A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know that your love is all you've got
At times things are so fine and at times they're not
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot

A friend says a love is never true
And you know that this don't apply on you
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
When she says she loves you that means a lot

Love can be deep inside, love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide what you feel when it's real

A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know your love is all you got
At touch can mean so much when it's all you got
When she says she loves you that means a lot
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah, can't you see, yeah
