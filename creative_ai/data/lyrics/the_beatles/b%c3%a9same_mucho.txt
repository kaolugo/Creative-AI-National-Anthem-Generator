Bsame. Bsame mucho. 
Each time I bring you a kiss 
I hear music divine. 
So bsame. Bsame mucho, 
I'll love you forever 
Say that you'll always be mine. 

Dearest one, if you should leave me 
Then each little dream will take wings 
And my life would be through. 
Oh, Bsame. Bsame mucho, 
Ooh I'll love you forever, 
Make all my dreams come true. 

Ooh this joy is something new, 
My arms are holding you, 
I never knew this thrill before. 
Who ever thought I'd be 
Holding you close to me 
Whispering "It's you I adore." 

Yeah, so dearest one, if you should leave me 
Then each little dream will take wings 
And my life would be through. 
Oh, so bsame. Bsame mucho, 
Yeah, I'll love you forever, 
Make all my dreams come true. 

Ooh this joy is something new, 
My arms are holding you, 
I never knew this thrill before. 
Who ever thought I'd be 
Holding you close to me 
Whispering "it's you I adore." 

Oh, so dearest one, if you should leave me, 
then each little dream will take wings 
and my life would be through. 
Oh, so bsame. Bsame mucho, 
And I'll love you forever, 
Make all my dreams come true. 
Ooh, love me forever, 
Make all my dreams come true. 
Ooh, love me forever, 
Make all my dreams come true.
