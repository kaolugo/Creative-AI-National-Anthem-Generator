Well that'll be the day 
When you say goodbye 
Yeah that'll be the day 
When you make me cry 
You say you're gonna leave, 
You know it's a lie 
Cos that'll be the day 
When I die 

Well you gave me all your loving 
And all your turtle doving, 
All your hugs and kisses 
And your money too 
You say you love me baby, 
Still you tell me maybe 
That somebody, well I'll be through. 

Well that'll be the day 
When you say goodbye 
That'll be the day 
When you make me cry 
You say you're gonna leave, 
You know it's a lie 
Cos that'll be the day 
When I die. 

Yes that'll be the day 
When you say goodbye 
Yes that'll be the day 
When you make me cry 
You say you're gonna leave, 
You know it's a lie 
Cos that'll be the day 
When I die 

Well when cupid shot his dart, 
He shot it at your heart 
So if we'll ever part, 
And I'll leave you 
You say and hold me, 
And you tell me boldly 
That some day, well I'll be through. 

Well that'll be the day 
When you say goodbye 
Yes that'll be the day 
When you make me cry 
You say you're gonna leave, 
You know it's a lie 
Cos that'll be the day 
When I die 

Yeah that'll be the day 
Ohoh that'll be the day 
Ohoh that'll be the day 
Ohoh that'll be the day
