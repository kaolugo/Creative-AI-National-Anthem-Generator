This happened once before when I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you, but I saw you peep through
Your window

I saw the light
I saw the light
I know that you saw me 'cause I looked up to see
Your face

I tried to telephone, they said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been and I saw you walk in
Your door

I nearly died
I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand with another man
In my place

If I were you I'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

I've tried to telephone, they said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been and I saw you walk in
Your door

I nearly died
I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
