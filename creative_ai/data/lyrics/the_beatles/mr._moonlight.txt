Mr. Moonlight

You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you send my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine
I think you're fine
'Cos we love you
Mr. Moonlight

Mr. Moonlight
Come again, please
Here I am on my knees
Begging if you please

On the night you don't come my way
I pray and pray more each day
'Cos we love you
Mr. Moonlight

On the night you don't come my way
Oh, I pray and pray more each day
'Cos we love you
Mr. Moonlight

Mr. Moonlight
Come again, please
Here I am on my knees
Begging if you please

On the night you don't come my way
Oh, I pray and pray more each day
'Cos we love you
Mr. Moonlight

Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight...
