Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby, take a chance with me

Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby, take a chance with me

If you want someone to make you feel so fine
Then we'll have some fun when you're mine, all mine
So come on, come on, come on

Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby, take a chance with me
Wow

When you're by my side you're the only one
Don't you run and hide
Just come on, come on
Yeah, come on, come on, come on

Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby, take a chance with me
Baby, take a chance with me
Baby, take a chance with me
