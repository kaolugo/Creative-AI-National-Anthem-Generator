You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry
It's through
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wond'ring why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no
Not a second time

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry
It's through

You're giving me the same old line
I'm wond'ring why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no
Not a second time
Not a second time
Not a second time
No, no, no, no, no
No, no no (not a second time)
No, no, no, no, no
