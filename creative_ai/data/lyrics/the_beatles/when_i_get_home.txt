Whoa, I
Whoa, I
I got a whole lot of thing to tell her
When I get home

Come on, out my way
'Cos I'm a-gonna see my baby today
I got a whole lot of things I gotta say
To her

Whoa, I
Whoa, I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

Come on, if you please
I got no time for triviality
I got a girl who's waiting home for me
Tonight

Whoa, I
Whoa, I
I got a whole lot of thing to tell her
When I get home

When I get'n home tonight
I'm gonna hold her tight
I'm gonna love her till the cows come home
I bet'n I'll love her more
Till I walk out that door
Again

Come on, let me through
I got so many things I gotta do
I got no business being here with you
This way

Whoa, I
Whoa, I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home, yeah
I got a whole lot of thing to tell her
When I get home
