I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor
And I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and so-old you

I look at the world
And I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
(With) every mistake
We must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
Yeah

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No-one alerted you

I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently wee-ee-eeps

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh (eee...)
Oh, oh, oh (... eee)

Oh, oh (eee...)
Oh, oh (... eee...)
Oh, oh (... eee)

Yeah, yeah, yeah (eee...)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (... eee...)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (... eee...)
Go! (... eee)

Oh (eee)
