I said I'm sitting here watching 
Matchbox holdin' my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering 
Matchbox holdin' my clothes
I ain't got no matches 
But I sure got a long way to go

I'm an old poor boy 
And I'm a long way from home
I'm an old poor boy 
And I'm a long way from home
I've never been happy 
'Cos everything I ever did was wrong

Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey
Please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches, honey
Please don't mess around my tree
I've got news for you, baby
Leave me here in misery
All right! 

Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog 
Till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here 
Watch how your puppy dog runs

Well, I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox holdin' my clothes
I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox holdin' my clothes
I ain't got no matches 
But I sure got a long way to go
