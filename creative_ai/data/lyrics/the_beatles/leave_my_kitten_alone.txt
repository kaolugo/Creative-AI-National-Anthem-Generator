You better leave my kitten all alone,
You better leave my kitten all alone.
Well, I told you, big, fat bulldog,
You better leave her alone.

You better leave my kitten all alone,
You better leave my kitten all alone.
This dog is gonna get you
If you don't leave her alone.

Well, Mister Dog
I'm gonna hit you on the top of your head.
That child is gonna miss you,
You're gonna wish
That you were dead.

If you don't leave my kitten all alone.
Well, I told you, big, fat bulldog,
You better leave her alone.

Well, alright!
Yeah!
Hey! Hey!
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Well, Mister Dog
I'm gonna hit you on the top of your head.
That gal is gonna miss you,
You're gonna wish
That you were dead.

If you don't leave my kitten all alone, oh yeah.
Well, I told you, big, fat bulldog,
You better leave her alone.

Hey-hey!
You better leave,
You better leave,
You better leave,
Yeah, you better leave,
You better leave,
Oh, you got to leave
Yeah, hey!
Well, I told you, big, fat bulldog.
