Without going out of my door,
I can know all things of earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels, the less one knows

The less one really knows
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels, the less one knows

The less one really knows
Arrive without traveling, see all without looking
Do all without doing
