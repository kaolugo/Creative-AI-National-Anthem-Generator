Spoken:
To your mother!

It's all too much 
It's all too much 

When I look into your eyes 
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside 
The more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around you 
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take 
It's all too much 

Floating down the stream of time 
From life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are 
Or where you'd like to be 

It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake 
So take a piece but not too much 

Sell me on a silver sun 
Where I know that I'm free 
Show me that I'm everywhere 
And get me home for tea 

It's all too much for me to take
There's plenty there for everybody
The more you give, the more you get
The more it is and it's too much

Nice to have the time to take
This opportunity
Time for me to look at you
And you to look at me

It's all too much for me to see 
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know 
And what I do is all too much 

It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around you 
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take 
It's all too much 

It's too much
It's too much

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue 
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue 
You're too much
We are getting better

Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much

Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much

Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too
