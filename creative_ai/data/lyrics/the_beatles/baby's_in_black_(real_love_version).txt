Spoken:
We'd like to do another number, 'cos that's what we're here for.   while Paul fiddles with his amplifier.  I hope you can hear me.  I'd be awfully disappointed if you couldn't.  We'd like to do another one from, er, one of our LPs, albums, long players, records.  (Oh, you're okay, are you?)  It's a slow number, and it's a waltz for all of you over ten.  (I can see you, Paul!)  Some people play fast waltzes, and some people play slow waltzes.  But we're going to play a slow one, and it's called "Baby's in Black".

Oh, dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black, and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh, what can I do?

She thinks of him 
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back 
She's dressed in black 

Oh, dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black, and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh, what can I do?

I think of her 
But she thinks only of him (of him)
And though it's only a whim
She thinks of him 

Oh, how long will it take 
Till she sees the mistake she has made? 
Dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black, and I'm feeling blue 
Tell me, oh, what can I do?

Oh, how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black, and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh, what can I do?

She thinks of him 
And so she dresses in black 
And though he'll never come back 
She's dressed in black 

Oh, dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black, and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh, what can I do?
