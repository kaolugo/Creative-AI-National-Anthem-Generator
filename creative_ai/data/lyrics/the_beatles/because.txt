Aaaaaaah-aaah
Because the world is round
It turns me on
Because the world is round

Aaaaaaah-aaah
Because the wind is high
It blows my mind
Because the wind is high

Aaaaaaah-ah
Love is old, love is new
Love is old, love is you

Because the sky is blue
It makes me cry
Because the sky is blue

Aah-a-a-a-ah-aah-a-ah-a-a-aah
Aah-a-a-a-a-a-ah-ah-ah-ah-aah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-a-a-aah
Aah-a-a-a-ah-aaaaah
