Running to and fro, hard-working at the mill
Never fails in the mail, yeah, comes a rotten bill
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to involve again

Salesman talking to me, trying to run me up a creek
Say, "You can buy, go one and try, you can pay me next week"
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to involve again

Long-haired, good-looking, trying to get me hooked
Wants me to marry, settle down, get a home, write a book
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to involve again

Been to Yokohama, been a-fighting in the war
Army bunk, Army go, Army chow, Army clothes
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to involve again

Same thing, every day, getting up, going to school
No need of me complaining, my objection's overruled
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to involve again

Working in the filling station, too many tasks
Wipe the windows, check the tires, check the oil, the dollar gas
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Don't want your botheration, get away, leave me
