When I see you I just dont know what to say
I'd like to be with you every hour of the day
So if you want me, just like I need you
You know what to do.

I watched walking by and you looked alone
I hope that you won't mind if I walk you back home
But if you want me, just like I need you
You know what to do.

Just call on me when you're lonely
I'll keep my love for you only
I'll call on you if Im lonely too

Just call on me when you're lonely
I'll keep my love for you only
I'll call on you if Im lonely too

Understand that I'll stay with you everyday
Make you love me more in everyway
So if you want me, just like I want you
You know what to do.
