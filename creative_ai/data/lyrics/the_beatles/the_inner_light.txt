Without going out of my door 
I can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of my window 
I can know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels 
The less one knows 
The less one really know

Without going out of your door
You can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of your window
You can know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels 
The less one knows 
The less one really know

Arrive without travelling 
See all without looking 
Do all without doing
