Ooh, my soul
Well, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby
Don't you know my love is true?
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
I said, get off of that money
I love, love, love, love, love
Ooh, my soul

Well, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme all the love you've got
Babe, babe, babe, babe, baby
Don't you know I love a lot?
Yeah, I love, love, love, love, love
Ooh, my soul

Well, now, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby
Don't you know my love is true?
I said, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Get off of that money
I love, love, love, love, love
Ooh, my soul

Well, now, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby
Don't you know my love is true?
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
I said, get off, get off of that money
I love, love, love, love, love
Ooh, my soul
