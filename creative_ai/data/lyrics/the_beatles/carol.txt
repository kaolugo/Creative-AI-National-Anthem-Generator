Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
Well I've got to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day

Well come into my machine 
So we can move on out
I know a jumping little joint 
Where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back on the highway 
Not too long a ride
Well, you take your car along 
And you park it outside
A little cutie takes your hat 
And you can thank her, ma'am
Well every time you're gonna drive
You find the joint is jammed

Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
Well I've a-got to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day

Well if you want to hear some music 
Like the boys all play
Hold tight, tap your foot
Don't let it carry you away
Don't let the heat overwhelm you
Because they play so loud 
While the music will treat you 
When they get a crowd
Well, you can dance
I know you will, you thought
I got my eyes on you baby
'Cuz you dance so good

Don't let him steal your heart away
I've got to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
Well I've a-got to learn to dance if it takes you all night and day
