You tell lies thinking I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me

I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
I'm down (down) (down on the ground)
I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down?

Man buys ring, woman throws it away
Same old thing happen every day

I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
I'm down (down) (down on the ground)
I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down?

We're all alone and there nobody else
She will still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself"

I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
Oh babe, I'm down (down) (down on the ground)
I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down?

Wowow!
Carry on, John!
Whoo!
Baby, you hear me?

Oh, baby, you know I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
I guess I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
I'm down on the ground (down) (I'm really down)
I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
Ah, baby, I'm upside-down (down)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (down)

I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
Oh, baby, I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
I'm feeling upside-down (down) (I'm really down)
Ooh, I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
Baby, I'm down (down)
Yeah
Oh, baby, I'm down (down)

Yeah, baby, I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
Well, baby, I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
Well, baby, baby, baby (down) (I'm really down)
Oh, baby, I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
I'm down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, yeah (down, down)
Oh, down, down (down)
