If you've got trouble, 
then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried, 
you can't be as worried as me
You're quite contend to be bad 
with all the vantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble 
and don't bring your troubles to me
I dont think it's funny 
when you ask for money and things,
especially when you're standing there 
wearing diamond and rings 
You think I'm soft in the head
well try someone softer instead anything 
It's not so funny 
when you know what money can bring
You better leave me alone, 
I don't need a thing from you 
You better take yourself home 
Go and count a ring or two 
If you've got trouble, 
then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried, 
you can't be as worried as me
You're quite contend to be bad 
with all the vantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble 
and don't bring your troubles to me
Ah rock on Anybody 
You better leave me alone,
I don't need a thing from you 
You better take yourself home 
Go and count a ring or two 
If you've got trouble, 
then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried, 
you can't be as worried as me
You're quite contend to be bad 
with all the vantage you had over me 
Just cause your trouble 
and don't bring your troubles to me
Just cause your trouble 
and don't bring your troubles to me
