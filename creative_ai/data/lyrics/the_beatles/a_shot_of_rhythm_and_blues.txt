Well, if your hands start a-clapping and your fingers start a-popping
And your feet start a-moving around
And if you start to swing and sway when the band start to play
A real cool and way-out sound
And if you get the Can't Help It, when you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move around

You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure
You get a pair of dancing shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure?

Don't you worry 'bout a thing, when you start to dance and sing
Until bumps come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets her, too
Well, here's the thing for you to do

Get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure?

Don't you worry 'bout a thing, when you start to dance and sing
Until bumps come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets her, too
Well, here's the thing for you to do

Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure?

Don't you worry 'bout a thing, when you start to dance and sing
Until bumps come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets her, too
Well, here's the thing for you to do
Well, here's the thing for you to do
Well, here's the thing for you to do
