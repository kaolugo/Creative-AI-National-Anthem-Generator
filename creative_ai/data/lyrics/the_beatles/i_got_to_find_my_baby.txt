I'm gonna search this town from door to door
Love I crave, I can't find no more
I gotta find my baby, I deserve a little light
Ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

You know, I hate to see the sun sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's gonna be one solid mess
I gotta find my baby, I deserve a little light
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Well, ever since that day when we said we were through
I've been nervous and shook up, too

I gotta find my baby, I deserve a little light
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye

Well, I don't care if it's the last thing I ever do in my life
I'm gonna find that little woman and make her my wife

I gotta find my baby, I deserve a little light
I ain't had no real loving
Since that woman said goodbye
