We're gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rockin' little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over, Beethoven
Gotta hit it again today

You know, my temperature's risin'
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart beatin' rhythm
And my soul keeps a-singing the blues
Roll over, Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rockin' pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I caught it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm revue
Roll over, Beethoven
Rockin' in two by two

Well, if you feel it and like it
Well, get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just
Trifle further and a-reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over, Beethoven
A-rockin' in two by two

Well, early in the mornin'
I'm a givin' you the warnin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey, diddle, diddle
I'm a-playin' my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over, Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she winks like a glow worm
Dance like a spinnin' top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see him reel an' rock
'S long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

Well, roll over, Beethoven
Yeah, roll over, Beethoven
Roll over, Beethoven
Oh, roll over, Beethoven
Roll over, Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues
