One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]
I'm hoping everyday
I'm gonna hear you say
"You really make my wish come true"

Can you feel when I'm holding you near
All the things that I do?
So, my love, am I making it clear?
One and one is two

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]

Can't you see I've loved you from the start?
Don't you love me too?
I love you, but you're breaking my heart
From wanting you.

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]

If you say that you're gonna be mine
Everything is alright
All the world would look so fine
If you'll be mine tonight

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you?

[Chorus]
