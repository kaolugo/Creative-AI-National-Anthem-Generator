For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight
On trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's fair
What a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world

The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday
At Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring
Don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks
Without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake
On solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
