If you wear red tonight 
Remember what I said tonight 
For red is the colour that my baby wore 
And what's more
It's true
Yes, it is

Scarlet were the clothes she wore 
Everybody knows, I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned 
Understand
It's true
Yes, it is
It's true
Yes, it is

I could be happy with you by my side 
If I could forget her
But it's my pride (aaaaaaah)
Yes, it is
Yes, it is
Oh, yes, it is
Yeah

Please don't wear red tonight 
This is what I said tonight 
For red is the colour that will make me blue 
In spite of you
It's true
Yes, it is
It's true
Yes, it is

I could be happy with you by my side 
If I could forget her
But it's my pride (aaaaaaah)
Yes, it is
Yes, it is
Oh, yes, it is
Yeah

Please don't wear red tonight 
This is what I said tonight 
For red is the colour that will make me blue 
In spite of you
It's true
Yes, it is
It's true
Yes, it is
It's true
