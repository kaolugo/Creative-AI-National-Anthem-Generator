Take the following with a pinch of salt:

Well, I got a woman, way on the  town
She's good to me, oh,yeah
Said, I got a woman, way on the  town
Good to me, oh, yeah
She gives me money, when i dime  need
Yes, she's the kind, read  indeed
Said, I got a woman, way 'cross town
She's good for me, oh,  yeah

She say she love me early in the morning
Just for me, oh, yeah
She say she love me early in the morning
Just for me, oh, yeah
She say she love me, just for me
Yes, she love me so tenderly
Said, I got a woman, way 'cross town
She's good to me, oh, yeah

She's there to love me, all day and night
Never grumbles or fusses, just treats me right
Never running in the streets, leaving me alone
She knows a woman's place is right back there
With a hand around the home

Got a woman, way 'cross town
She's good to me, oh, yeah
Well, I got a woman, way 'cross town
She's good to me, oh, yeah
Well, she's my baby, don't you understand
That I, I, I , I, I'm her loving man?
Said, I got a woman, way 'cross town
She's good to me, oh, oh, yeah

Well, it's all right
Well, it's all right
I got a woman, way 'cross time
She's good to me, oh, oh, oh, yeah
