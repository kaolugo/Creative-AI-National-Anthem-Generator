Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

Nothing to do to save his life
Call his wife in
Nothing to say but "What a day!"
"How's your boy been?"
Nothing to do
It's up to you
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"

Good morning
Good morning 
Good morning

Going to work
Don't want to go
Feeling low down
Heading for home
You start to roam
Then you're in town

Everybody knows
There's nothing doing
Everything is closed
It's like a ruin
Everyone you see
Is half asleep
And you're on your own
You're in the street

After a while you start to smile
Now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk
By the old school
Nothing has changed
It's still the same
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"

Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

People running 'round
It's five o'clock
Everywhere in town
Is getting dark
Everyone you see
Is full of life
It's time for tea
And Meet the Wife

Somebody needs to know the time
Glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt
Now you're in gear
Go to a show
You hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"

Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good

Guten morgen, guten morgen, gut
Guten morgen, guten morgen, gut
Guten morgen, guten morgen, gut
Guten morgen, guten morgen, gut
(Ja! Ja!)

Guten morgen, guten morgen, gut
(Ja!)
Guten morgen, guten morgen, gut
Gewozei teuer
Guten morgen, guten morgen, good morning!
(Hey!)
