Sitting here la la
Waiting for my ya ya
Sitting here la la
Waiting for my ya ya

It may sound funny
But I don't think she's comin' home

Baby, hurry, don't keep me worry
Baby, hurry, now don't keep me worry, no
You know how I love you
Oh, how much I love you

Sitting here la la
Waiting for my ya ya
Sitting here la la
Waiting for my ya ya

It may sound funny
But I don't think she's comin' home

Sitting here
We're sitting here

Sitting here la la
Waiting for my ya ya
Sitting here la la
Waiting for my ya ya
