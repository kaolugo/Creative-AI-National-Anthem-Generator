Crying (crying)
Waiting (waiting)
Hoping (hoping)
You'll come back
I just can't seem
To get you off my mind

Crying (crying)
Waiting (waiting)
Hoping (hoping)
You'll come back
You're the one I love
I think about you all the time

Crying (crying, doot-doot-doo)
Tears keep a-falling
All night long
Waiting (waiting, doot-doot-doo)
It seems so useless
I know it's wrong
To keep on
Crying (crying)
Waiting (waiting)
Hoping (hoping)
You'll come back, baby
Someday soon
Things will change and you'll be mine

Crying (crying, doot-doot-doo)
Tears keep a-falling
All night long
Waiting (waiting, doot-doot-doo)
It seems so useless
I know it's wrong
To keep on
Crying (crying)
Waiting (waiting)
Hoping (hoping)
You'll come back
Maybe someday soon
Things will change and you'll be mine

Crying (crying)
Waiting (waiting)
Hoping (hoping)
