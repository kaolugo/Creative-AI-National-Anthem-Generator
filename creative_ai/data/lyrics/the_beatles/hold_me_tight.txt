It feels so right now
Hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one

So hold (hold) me tight (me tight)
Tonight (tonight), tonight (tonight)
It's you
You, you, you

Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you

So hold (hold) me tight (me tight)
Tonight (tonight), tonight (tonight)
It's you
You, you, you

Don't know
What it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you

It feels so right now
Hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one

So hold (hold) me tight (me tight)
A-tonight (tonight), tonight (tonight)
It's you
You, you, you

Don't know
What it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you

It feels so right now
Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you

So hold (hold) a-me tight (me tight)
Tonight (tonight), tonight (tonight)
It's you
You, you, you
