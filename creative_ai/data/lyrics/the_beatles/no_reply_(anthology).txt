This happened once before 
When I came to your door 
No reply 
They said it wasn't you 
But I saw you peep through 
Your window 

I saw the light 
I saw the light 
I know that you saw me 
'Cause I looked up to see 
Your face 

I tried to telephone 
They said you were not home 
That's a lie 
'Cause I know where you've been 
I saw you walk in 
Your door 

I nearly died 
I nearly died 
'Cause you walked hand in hand 
With another man 
In my place 

If I were you 
I'd realize that I 
Love you more 
Than any other guy 
And I'll forgive 
The lies that I 
Heard before 
When you gave me no reply 

This happened once before 
When I came to your door 
No reply 
They said it wasn't you 
But I saw you peep through 
Your window 

I saw the light 
I saw the light 
I know that you saw me 
'Cause I looked up to see 
Your face
