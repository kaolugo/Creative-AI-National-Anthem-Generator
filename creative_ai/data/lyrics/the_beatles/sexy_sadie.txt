Sexy Sadie, what have you done?
You made a fool of everyone
You made a fool of everyone (wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa)
Sexy Sadie (wa wa wa wa), oh, what have you done? (wa wa wa wa)

(Wa wa wa wa)
Sexy Sadie (wa wa wa wa wa wa wa), you broke the rules
You laid it down for all to see
You laid it down for all to see (see see see see see see see see)
Sexy Sadie (see see see see), oh, you broke the rules (see see see see)

(Sexy Sadie, oh) One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover
She came along to turn on everyone 
Sexy Sadie (sexy Sadie)
The greatest (she's the greatest) of them all (wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa)

Sexy Sadie, how did you know
The world was waiting just for you?
The world was waiting just for you (wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa)
Sexy Sadie (wa wa wa wa), oh, how did you know? (wa wa wa wa)

(Wa wa wa wa)
Sexy Sadie (wa wa wa wa wa wa waa), you'll get yours yet 
However big you think you are 
However big you think you are (wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa)
Sexy Sadie (wa wa wa wa), oh, you'll get yours yet (wa wa wa)

(Sexy Sadie) We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table 
Just a smile would lighten everything 
Sexy Sadie (sexy Sadie)
She's the latest and the greatest (she's the greatest) of them all
(Sexy Sadie)
(She's the latest and the greatest of them all)

Woo

She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie (Sexy Sadie)

However big you think you are 
Sexy Sadie (Sexy Sadie)
