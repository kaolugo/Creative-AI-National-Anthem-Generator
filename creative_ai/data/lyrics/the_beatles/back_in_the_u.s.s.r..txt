Oh
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC 
Didn't get to bed last night 
On the way the paper bag was on my knee 
Man, I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the USSR

Been away so long I hardly knew the place 
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case 
Honey, disconnect the phone
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S.
Back in the U.S.
Back in the USSR

Well, the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind 
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout 
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my my mind

Oh, come on
Whoo, hey
Whoo, ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Hey, I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the USSR

Well, the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my my mind

Oh, show me round your snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm 
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the USSR
Hey!
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the USSR

Oh, let me tell you, honey
Hey, I'm back
I'm back in the USSR
Hey, it's so good to be here
Yeah, back in the USSR
I'm back!
