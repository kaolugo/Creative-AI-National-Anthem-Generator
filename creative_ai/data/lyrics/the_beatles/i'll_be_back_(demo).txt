One two three, one two.

You know if you break my heart I'll go
but I'll be back again
cause I told you once before goodbye
but I came back again.

I love you so oh
I'm the one who wants you
yes I'm the one who wants you oh ho oh ho.

Oh you could find better things to do
than to break my heart again
this time I will try to show that I'm
not trying to pretend.

I thought that you would realize--

John: It's too hard to sing!

(growls):
That if I ran away from you,
that you would want me--

John: When I start going 'woh, woh' about eight times.
Paul: I just want to sing that bit.
John: One, two, three...
