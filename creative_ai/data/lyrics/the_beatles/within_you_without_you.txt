We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away

We were talking about the love we all could share when we find it
To try our best to hold it there
With our love
With our love we could save the world
If they only knew

Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know
They can't see
Are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see
We're all one and life flows on within you and without you
