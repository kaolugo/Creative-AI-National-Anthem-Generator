A bad little kid
Moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right
Just'n sitting down and look so good
He don't wanna go to school
And learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays
That rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teacher's chair
Put chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, Junior, behave yourself

Buy every rock and roll book
On the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets
Oh! is off to the jukebox man
Well, he worries his'n teacher
Till at night she's a-ready to poop
From rockin' and a-rollin'
Spinning in a hula-hoop
Well, this rock and roll has gotta stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, Junior, behave yourself

Ow!
Ah!
Ow!

Gonna tell your mama
You'd better do what she said
Get to the barber shop
And get that hair cut off your head
You shoot canary
And you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel
A bath in mother's laundromat
Well, your mama's mess has gotta stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, Junior, behave yourself

Whoo!
