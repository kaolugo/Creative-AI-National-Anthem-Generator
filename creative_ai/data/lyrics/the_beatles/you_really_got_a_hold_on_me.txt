I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly

You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now

You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I love you and all that I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

Tighter
Tighter
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, I want to split now
I just can't quit now

You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I love you and all that I want you to do
Is just hold me (please), hold me (squeeze), hold me, hold me

You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
