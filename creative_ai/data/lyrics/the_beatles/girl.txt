Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl
You want so much it makes you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

When I think of all the times
I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

(Tit-tit-tit-tit tit-tit-tit-tit)
She's the kind of girl who puts you down
(Tit-tit-tit-tit)
When friends are there (tit-tit-tit-tit)
You feel a fool (tit-tit-tit-tit tit-tit-tit-tit)
(Tit-tit-tit-tit tit-tit-tit-tit)
When you say she's looking good (tit-tit-tit-tit tit-tit-tit-tit)
She acts as if it's understood (tit-tit-tit-tit tit-tit-tit-tit)
She's cool (tit-tit-tit-tit)
Ooh (tit-tit-tit-tit)
Ooh (tit-tit-tit-tit)
Ooh (tit-tit-tit-tit)
Girl
Girl, girl

Was she told when she was young
That pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back
To earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

Ah, girl
Girl, girl
