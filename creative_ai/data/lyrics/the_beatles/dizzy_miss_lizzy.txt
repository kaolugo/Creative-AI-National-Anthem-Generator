You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
The way you rock and roll
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When you do the stroll
Come on, Miss Lizzy
Love me 'fore I grow too old

Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy, dizz, Lizzy
Ooh, girl, you look so fine
Just a-rockin' an' a-rollin'
Girl, I said I wish you were mine

You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When you call my name
Ooh, baby
Say you're driving me insane
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
I want to be your loving man

Run and tell your mama
I want you to be my bride
Run and tell your brother
Baby, don't run and hide
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
Girl, I want to marry you

Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine, girl
You make me dizzy, dizzy, Lizzy
Girl, you look so fine
You're just a-rockin' and a-rollin'
Ooh, I said I wish you were mine
