Spoken:
... Yellow submarine
And we will march till three the day
To see them gathered there
From Land O' Groats to John O' Green
With Stepney do we tread
To see us yellow submarine
We love it

In the town where I was born 
Lived a man who sailed to sea 
And he told us of his life 
In the land of submarines 
So we sailed on to the sun 
Till we found a sea of green 
And we lived beneath the waves 
In our yellow submarine 

We all live in a yellow submarine 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine 
We all live in a yellow submarine 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine 

And our friends are all aboard 
Many more of them live next door 
And the band begins to play 

We all live in a yellow submarine 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine 
We all live in a yellow submarine 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine 

Spoken:
Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead 
Full speed ahead it is, Sir
Cut the cable, drop the cable 
Aye-aye, Sir, aye-aye
Captain, captain

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Every one of us (every one of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) slubmarine (submarine, a-ha!)

We all live in a yellow submarine 
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine 
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow subma
