We said our good-byes (ah, the night before)
Love was in your eyes (ah, the night before)
Now today I find
You have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

Were you telling lies? (ah, the night before)
Was I so unwise? (ah, the night before)
When I held you near
You were so sincere
A-treat me like you did the night before

Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me wanna cry

A-treat me like you did the night before

Yes

When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before (hey)

A-last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me wanna cry

Were you telling lies? (ah, the night before)
Was I so unwise? (ah, the night before)
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
A-like the night before
