I'm looking through you 
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you 
What did I know?
You don't look different 
But you have changed 
I'm looking through you 
You're not the same 

Your lips are moving 
I cannot hear 
Your voice is soothing
But the words aren't clear 
You don't sound different 
I've learned the game 
I'm looking through you 
You're not the same 

Why, tell me why 
Did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit 
Of disappearing overnight 

You're thinking of me 
The same old way 
You were above me 
But not today 
The only difference 
Is you're down there 
I'm looking through you
And you're nowhere 

Why, tell me why 
Did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit 
Of disappearing overnight 

I'm looking through you 
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you 
What did I know?
You don't look different 
But you have changed 
I'm looking through you 
You're not the same 

Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Aah, and I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you 
A-you've changed, you've changed 
You've changed, you've changed
Yes, you've changed
I'm looking
