Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good looking but she looks like a man (aah-aah-aah)
Well, you should see her in drag (aaah)
Dressed in her polythene bag (ah-ah-ah-ah)
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam (aah-aah-aah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Spoken:
Hey!

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt (aah-aah-aah)
She's the kind of a girl (aaah)
That makes the News of the World (ah-ah-ah-ah)
Yes, you could say she was attractively built (aah-aah-aah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Spoken:
Yeah!

Spoken:

Great!
