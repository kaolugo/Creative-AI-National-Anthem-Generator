My baby says she's travelling
On the one after 909 
I said
Move over honey 
I'm travelling on that line
I said
Move over once
Move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go 
And I begged her on my bended knee (yes, I did)
You're only fooling 'round
Only fooling 'round with me
I said
Move over once 
Move over twice 
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

Pick up my bags, run to the station 
Railman said
You've got the wrong location 
Pick up the bag, run right home 
Then I find I've got the number wrong 

Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said
Move over honey 
I'm travelling on that line
I said
Move over once
Move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

Yeah

Pick up my bags, run to the station
Railman said
You've got the wrong location (yeah) 
Pick up my bags, run right home (run right home) 
Then I find I got the number wrong

Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said
Move over honey 
I'm travelling on that line
I said
Move over once
Move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 9-0
She said she's travelling on the one after 9-0
She said she's travelling on the one after 909
