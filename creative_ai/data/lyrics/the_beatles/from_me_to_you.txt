Da-da-daa da-da-dum dum daa
Da-da-daa da-da-dum dum daa

If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me, and I'll send it along
With love from me to you

I got everything that you want
Like a heart that's, oh, so true
Just call on me, and I'll send it along
With love from me to you

I got arms that long to hold you and keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you and keep you satisfied
Ooh!

If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me, and I'll send it along
With love from me to you

From me
To you
Just call on me, and I'll send it along
With love from me to you

I got arms that long to hold you and keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you and keep you satisfied
Ooh!

If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me, and I'll send it along
With love from me to you

To you
To you
To you
To you
