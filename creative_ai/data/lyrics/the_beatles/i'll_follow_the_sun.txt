One day you'll look 
To see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

Some day you'll know 
I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll find 
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

Yeah, tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll find 
That I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so
I'll follow the sun
