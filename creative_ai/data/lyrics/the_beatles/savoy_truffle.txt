Creme tangerine, Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream, nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues (whoo)
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You might not feel it now
When the pain cuts through
You're gonna know, and how!
The sweat is gonna fill your head (whoa)
When it becomes too much, you'll shout aloud

But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now turns so sour
We all know o-bla-di-bla-da
But can you show me where you are?

Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news (whoo)
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Yes, you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
