I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people

Picks up the rice in the church where her wedding has been
Lives in a dream waits at the window
Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door, who is it for?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?

Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near look at him working
Nodding his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?

I look at all the lonely people
I look at all the lonely people

Died in the church and was buried alone with her name, nobody came
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from her grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
