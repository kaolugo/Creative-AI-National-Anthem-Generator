The best things in life are free
But you can keep 'em for the birds and bees

Now give me money (that's what I want)

Your lovin' give me a thrill
But your lovin' don't pay my bills

That's what I want (that's what I want)
That's what I want (that's what I want), oh, yeah
That's what I want

Money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
