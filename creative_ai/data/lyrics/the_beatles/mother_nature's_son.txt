Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting
Singing songs for everyone

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty
Sound of music as she flies

Doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo-oo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo-oo doo doo doo
Ndoo doo-doo

Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing
A lazy song beneath the Sun

Doo-doo doo doo doo doo
Doo-oo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo-oo doo doo doo
Doo doo-doo doo-oo doo-doo
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Mm mm mm
Mmm mm
Mmm mm mm

Mm, Mother Nature's son
