Standing in the garden
Waiting for the sun to shine
Hand my umbrella
With this dirt I wish she was mine
Everybody doves, think a thing
It didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows
I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watching rainbows
I'm gonna make me some

Standing in the garden
Waiting for the english sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Lookin' at the bench of next door neighbours
Cryin' to my mum I'm tryin' to set sabors
Everybody's got to have something hard to grow

Well, instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son and make you one
You gotta get out son and make you run
Because you're not gonna make it if you cry, though

Shoot big!
Shoot big!
Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody
To get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big!
You gotta shoot big!
Until you shoot big
I can't stand
