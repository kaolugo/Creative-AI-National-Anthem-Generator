Control room: No reply, take one!
One two three four, one.

This happened once before
when I came to your door no reply
they said it wasn't you
but I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light.
I know that you saw me
cause I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
they said you were not home that's a lie
cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door (your face)
I nearly died.
Cause you walked hand in hand
with another man
Your face

If I were you I'd realize that I
love you more than any other guy
and I'll forgive the lies that I
heard before when you gave me no reply.

This happened once before (oh yeah)
when I came to your door no reply
they said it wasn't you
but I saw you peep through-- your face
