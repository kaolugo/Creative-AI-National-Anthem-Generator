Well, come on, pretty baby, won't you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, won't you talk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, give me one more chance 
Try and save our romance 
Slow down 

Baby, now you're moving way too fast 
You gotta gimme little lovin'
Gimme little lovin'
Ow!
If you want our love to last 

Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school
Carry your books home, too 
But now you got a boyfriend down the street/don't care a dime for me
Baby, what're you trying to do?
You'd better slow down 

Baby, now you're moving way too fast 
You gotta gimme little lovin'
Gimme little lovin'
Brrr!
If you want our love to last 

Ow!
Ow!

Well, you know that I love you, tell the world I do 
Come on, pretty baby, why can't you be true?
I need your bunny, baby, oh, so bad
The best little woman I ever had 
Slow down 

Baby, now you're moving way too fast 
You gotta gimme little lovin'
Gimme little lovin'
Ow!
If you want our love to last

Ow!
Whoo!
