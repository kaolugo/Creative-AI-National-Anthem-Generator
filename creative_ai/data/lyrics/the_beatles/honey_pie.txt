She was a working girl
North of England way
(Now, she's hit the big time)
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say

Honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?

Oh, honey pie
My position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend
Of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Oh, honey pie
You are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me

Oo
Yeah

I like it like that (oo, ah)
I like this kind of, hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me
Hollywood blues

Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me? t-t-tee
Now, honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?
Come, come back to me, honey pie, ha, ha, ha
Hoo-woo-doo ooh-ooh
Bo bo
Buh-huh-buh wa-ooh-uh bo bo
Honey pie, honey pie
