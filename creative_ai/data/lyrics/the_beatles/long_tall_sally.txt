I'm gonna tell Aunt Mary
'Bout Uncle John
He said he had to visit
But he got a lot of fun

Oh, baby
Yeah, now, baby
Whoo-oo-oo
Baby
Some fun tonight

I saw Uncle John
With long tall Sally
He saw Aunt Mary comin'
And he ducked back in the alley

Oh, baby
Yeah, now, baby
Whoo-oo-oo
Baby
Some fun tonight
Ow!

Ow!

Well, long tall Sally's built
Pretty sweet
She's got
Everything that Uncle John need

Oh, baby
Yeah, now, baby
Whoo-oo-oo
Baby
Some fun tonight
Ow!

Well, we're gonna have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Ooh!
Everything's all right
Have some fun tonight
Have some fun
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Wow!
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Everything's all right
Have some fun tonight
Yeah, we'll have some fun
Some fun tonight
