He's a real nowhere man 
Sitting in his nowhere land 
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Doesn't have a point of view 
Knows not where he's going to 
Isn't he a bit like you and me? 

Nowhere man, please listen (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
You don't know what you're missing (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Nowhere man (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
The world is at your command (aaah-aah-lala-lala-la)

He's as blind as he can be 
Just sees what he wants to see 
Nowhere man, can you see me at all?

Nowhere man, don't worry (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Take your time; don't hurry (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Leave it all (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Till somebody else lends you a hand (aaah-aah-lala-lala)

Doesn't have a point of view 
Knows not where he's going to 
Isn't he a bit like you and me? 

Nowhere man please listen (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
You don't know what you're missing (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
Nowhere man (aaah-ah-la-la-la)
The world is at your command (aaah-aah-lala-lala)

He's a real nowhere man 
Sitting in his nowhere land 
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody 
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
