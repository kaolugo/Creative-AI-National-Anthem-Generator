I want a love that's right
Right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short-haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now
I'm telling you

You know, you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
When I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
So glad you came here
Won't be the same now
When I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you'll say
I'll live and love but maybe some day
Who knows, baby?
You may comfort me
Hey!

I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby?
You may comfort me

(Hey) I know my love is yours to miss
That love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late (hey)
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

And I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
