When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)

I don't know why you (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
Should want to hide (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
But I can't get through (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
My hands are tied (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
I won't want to stay (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
I don't have much to say (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
But I'd get turned away (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
And you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing (No, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't)

Though the days are few (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
They're filled with tears (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
And since I lost you (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
It feels like years (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
Yes, it seems so long (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
Girl, since you've been gone (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
And I just can' go on (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
If you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing (No, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't)

Though the days are few (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
They're filled with tears (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
And since I lost you (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
It feels like years (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
Yes, it seems so long (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
Girl, since you've been gone (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
And I just can' go on (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
If you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)

Hey! Ah-ah! Yeah, yeah! Woah, woah.
(Ooh-ooh la la-la)
(Ooh-ooh la la-la)
(Ooh-ooh la la-la)
