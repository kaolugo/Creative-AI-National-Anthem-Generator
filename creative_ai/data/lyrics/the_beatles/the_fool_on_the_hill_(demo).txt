Day after day alone on the hill 
The man with the foolish grin 
is keeping perfectly still 
But nobody wants to know him 
They can see that he's just a fool 
And he never gives an answer 

But the fool on the hill 
sees the sun going down 
And the eyes in his head 
See the world spinning round 

Well on the way, his head in a cloud 
The man of a thousand voices 
is talking perfectly loud 
But nobody ever hears him 
Or the sound he appears to make 
And he never seems to notice 

But the fool on the hill 
sees the sun going down 
And the eyes in his head 
See the world spinning round 

Oh, round, round, round, round, round 
And nobody seems to like him 
they can tell what he wants to do 
And he never shows his feelings 

But the fool on the hill 
sees the sun going down 
And the eyes in his head 
See the world spinning round 

Oh, round, round, round, round, round 
And he never listen to them 
He knows that they're the fools 
But they don't like him 

The fool on the hill 
sees the sun going down 
And the eyes in his head 
See the world spinning round 

Oh, round, round, round, round, round 
oh
