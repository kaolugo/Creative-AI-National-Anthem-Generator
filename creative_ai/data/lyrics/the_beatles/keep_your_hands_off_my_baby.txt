We've been friends for, oh, so long
I let you share what's mine
When you mess with the girl I love
It's time to draw the line 

Keep your hands off my baby (Keep your hands)
Ain't a-gonna tell you, but a one more time
So keep your hands off my baby (Keep your hands)
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine 

I don't mind if you lend my clothes
But you will be indebted
Here is something that you get straight
There's one thing you don't touch 

Keep your hands off my baby (Keep your hands)
Ain't a-gonna tell you, but a one more time
So keep your hands off my baby (Keep your hands)
Can't you get it through your head?
That girl is mine 

Baby 

Keep your hands off my baby (Keep your hands)
Ain't a-gonna tell you, but a one more time
So keep your hands off my baby (Keep your hands)
Can't you get it through your head?
That girl is mine 

Oh, keep your hands off my baby, now
She's mine
Keep your hands off my baby
You'd better watch yourself, now
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine
