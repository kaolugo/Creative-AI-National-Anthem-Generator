Step inside love and stay, 
Step inside love. 
Step inside love. 
Step inside love. 
I want you to stay. 

You look tired, love, 
let me turn down the light. 
Come in out of the cold, 
rest your head on my shoulder 
and kiss me tonight. 
We are together now 
and forever, come my way. 

Step inside love and stay, 
step inside love, 
step inside love, 
step inside love, 
I want you to stay.
