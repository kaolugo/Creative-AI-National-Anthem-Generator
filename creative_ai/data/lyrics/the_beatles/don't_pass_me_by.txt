I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

I hear the clock a-ticking
On the mantel shelf
See the hands a-moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more?

Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said, that's all right
I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you

Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
