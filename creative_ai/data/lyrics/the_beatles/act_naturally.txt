They're going to put me in the movies
They're going to make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I got to do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm going to be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movie's going to make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then Ill know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I got to do is act naturally

We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally

Well, I'll bet you I'm going to be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movie's going to make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
Then Ill know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I got to do is act naturally
