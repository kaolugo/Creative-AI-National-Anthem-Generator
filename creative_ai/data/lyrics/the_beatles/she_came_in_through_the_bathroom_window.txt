Spoken:
Oh listen to that now
Heh-heh-heh!
Oh, look out!
Yeah

She came in through the bathroom window (ahh-ooooh)
Protected by a silver spoon (ahh-ah-ah-ooooh)
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders (ahh-ah-ah-ooooh)
By the banks of her own lagoon (ooooh-ooh)

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday
Tuesdays on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew, but I could not say

And so I quit the Police Department (ahh-ooooh)
And got myself a steady job (ahh-ah-ah-ooooh)
And though she tried her best to help me (ahh-ah-ah-ooooh)
She could steal, but she could not rob (ooooh-ooh)

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sundays on the phone to Monday
Tuesdays on the phone to me
Oh, yeah
