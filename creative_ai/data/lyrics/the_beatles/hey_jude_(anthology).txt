From the heart of the black country: 

When I was a robber in Boston place 
you gathered round me with your fine embrace 

Hey Jude, don't make it bad 
Take a sad song and make it better 
Remember to let her into your heart, 
then you can start to make it better 

Hey Jude, don't be afraid 
You were made to go out and get her 
The minute you'll let her under your skin, 
then you'll begin to make it better 

And anytime you feel a pain, 
hey Jude, refrain, 
don't carry the world upon your shoulders 
For well you know that it's a fool 
who plays it cool 
by making his world a little colder 

Hey Jude, don't let me down 
She has found you, go and get her 
Remember to let her into your heart, 
then you can start to make it better, 
better better better 

So let it out and let it in, 
hey Jude, begin, 
you're waiting for someone to perform with 
And don't you know that it's just you, 
hey Jude, you'll do, 
the movement you need is on your shoulder 

Hey Jude, don't make it bad 
Take a sad song and make it better 
Remember to let her into your heart, 
that you can start to make it better, 
better, better, better, better, 

Na na na nananana nananana hey Jude, 
na na na nananana I'll make ity Jude 
nananana hey Jude, hey Jude 
Na na na nananana I'll make it Jude, 
nananana hey Jude, yeah 
na na na nananana nananana oh yeah yeah yeah 
Make it Jude
