I never knew that a day like today laid before us
I've got the sun in my heart and my heart's in the sun
Skies are as bright as your eyes
The horizon is open
Love is a ceiling, feelings are reeling, free as the air

Forever on and forever
Forever on, side by side
Whoever knew that we two could be free as we'd fancied?
Fancy is free, but are we, who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love?

Whoever knew that we two could be free as we'd fancied?
Fancy is free, but are we, who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love?
