Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la

It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart
Many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself

'Cos, baby, it's you
Baby, it's you (Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la!)

You should hear what they say about you
Cheat, cheat
They say, they say you never never never ever been true (Cheat, cheat)
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, when it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody

'Cos, baby, it's you
Baby, it's you (Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la!)

It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, when it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody

'Cos, baby, it's you
Baby, it's you (Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!)
Don't leave me all alone
Come on home
