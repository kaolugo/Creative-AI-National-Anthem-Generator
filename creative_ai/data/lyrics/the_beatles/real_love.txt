All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all we really were doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
 
It's real love
It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal
Yes, it's real love
It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

It's real love
It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal
Yes, it's real love
It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal

Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you-ou-ou-ou

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

It's rea-ea-eal love
(Yes) It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal
(Yes) It's rea-ea-eal love
It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal
Yes, it's rea-ea-eal love
It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal
It's rea-ea-eal love
(Yes) It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal
Yes, it's rea-ea-eal love
It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal
It's rea-ea-eal love
It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal
Yes, it's rea-ea-eal love
It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal
It's rea-ea-eal love
It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal
Yes, it's rea-ea-eal love
It's rea-ea-ea-ea-eal
