She looks as an African queen, 
she eating twelve chapattis and cream, 
she tastes as Mongolian lamb, 
she coming from out of Bahran. 

What a shame Mary Jane 
had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
had a pain at the party. 

She like to be married with Yeti, 
he grooving such cooky spaghetti, 
she jumping as Mexican bean 
to make that her body more thin. 

What a shame Mary Jane 
had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
had a pain at the party. 

She catch Patagonian pancake 
with that one a gin party makes. 
She having all the ways good contacts, 
she making with Apple an contract. 

What a shame Mary Jane 
had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
had a pain at the party. 

All together now: 

What a shame Mary Jane 
had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
had a pain at the party. 

She looks as an African queen, 
she tastes as Mongolian lamb. 

What a shame Mary Jane 
had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
had a pain at the party. 

What a shame Mary Jane 
had a pain at the party. 
What a shame Mary Jane. 
What a shame Mary Jane 
had a pain at the party.
