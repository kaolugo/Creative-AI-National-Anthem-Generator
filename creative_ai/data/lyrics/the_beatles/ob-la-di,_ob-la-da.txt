Desmond has a barrow at the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (rin-ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing (sing)

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da (la-la-la-la la-la-)
Life goes on, bra (la-la la-la-la-laaa)
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da (la-la-la-la la-la-)
Life goes on, bra (la-la la-la-la-laaa)
La-la, how the life goes on
Yeah

In a couple of years
They have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (ha ha ha ha)

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (arm!) (leg!)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

Yes!
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Hey!
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on

In a couple of years
They have built a home sweet home (home: H-O-M-E)
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)

Hey!
Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand (foot!)
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band

Yeah!
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Hey!
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on (ha ha ha ha)
And if you want some fun (ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
Take Ob-la-di-bla-da (ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(ha ha ha ha)

Ahh...
Thank you (ha ha)
