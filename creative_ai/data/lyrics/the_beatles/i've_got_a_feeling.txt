I've got a feeling
A feeling deep inside
Oh, yeah
(Oh, yeah)
(That's right)
I've got a feeling
A feeling I can't hide
Oh, no, no
Oh, no!
Oh, no
Yeah
Yeah
I've got a feeling
Yeah
Ooh

Oh, please believe me
I'd hate to miss the train
Oh, yeah (yeah)
Oh, yeah!
And if you leave me
I won't be late again
Oh, no
Oh, no!
Oh, no
Yeah, yeah
I've got a feeling
Yeah
I got a feeling

All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you

I've got a feeling
That keeps me on my toes
Oh, yeah
(Oh, yeah)
I've got a feeling
I think that everybody knows
Oh, yeah
(Oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I have got a feeling
Yeah
(Yeah)

Everybody had a hard year
Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream
Everybody saw the sun shine
Oh, yeah (oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
(Yeah)
Everybody had a good year
Everybody let their hair down
Everybody pulled their socks up (yeah?)
Everybody put their foot down
Oh, yeah

(Yeah)
(Whoo-hoo!)
(I've got a feeling) Everybody had a good year
(A feeling deep inside) Everybody had a hard time
(Oh, yeah) Everybody had a wet dream
(Oh, yeah) Everybody saw the sun shine
(I've got a feeling) Everybody had a good year
(A feeling I can't hide) Everybody let their hair down
(Oh, no) Everybody pull their socks up
(Oh, no, no) Everybody put their foot down
Oh, yeah (Yeah)

I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
(Oh, yeah)
I've got a feeling
Yeah

Spoken:
Oh, my soul
So hard
