Lay down your arms (soldier of love)
And surrender to me
Lay down your arms (soldier of love)
And love me peacefully, yeah
Use your arms for loving me
Baby, that's the way it's gotta be

There ain't no reason for you to be bad
For you're the woman and I love you so
So forget the other boys, 'cuz my love is real
Come off your battlefield

Lay down your arms (soldier of love)
And love me peacefully
Lay down your arms
And love me tenderly (soldier of love)
Yeah, use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't wanna fight no more 

The weapons you're using are hurting me bad
And someday you're gonna see
'Cuz my love for you baby
Is the truest you've ever had
A soldier of love is hard to beat

Lay down your arms of love (soldier of love)
And love me peacefully
Lay down your arms of love (soldier of love)
And surrender to me
Yeah, use your arms to squeeze
And please 'cuz I'm the one that loves you so

(Soldier of love)
Baby lay down your arms
(Soldier of love)
Baby lay down your arms
