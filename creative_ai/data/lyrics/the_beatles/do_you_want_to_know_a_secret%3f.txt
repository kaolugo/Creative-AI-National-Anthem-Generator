You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care

Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?

Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you

Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you

I've known a secret for a week or two
Nobody knows
Just we two

Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell?
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you
