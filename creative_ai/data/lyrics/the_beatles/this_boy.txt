That boy
Took my love away
Oh, he'll regret it someday-ay
But this boy wants you back again

That boy
Isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Oh, and this boy (ahhh)
Would be happy (ahhh)
Just to love you (ahhh)
But oh, my-y-y-y (ahhh)
That boy (ahhh)
Won't be happy (ahhh)
Till he's seen you cry (ahhh)

This boy
Wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the sa-ame
If this boy gets you back again

This boy
This boy
This boy
