I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation T-shirt
Stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the Eggman (whoo!)
They are the Eggmen (whoo!)
I am the Walrus
Goo goo g'joob

Mister city policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm crying
I'm cry-'-ng (Ahhh!)
I'm crying
I'm cry-'- (whoooo!)

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife
Pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down

I am the Eggman
They are the Eggmen
I am the Walrus
Goo goo g'joob

Sitting in an English garden
Waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come
You get a tan from standing in the English rain

I am the Eggman (Now, good sir, ...)
They are the Eggmen (... poor man, made tame to fortune's...)
I am the Walrus
Goo goo g'joob goo goo g'joob

Expert texpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
(Ho-ho-ho!  Hee-hee-hee!  Ha-ha-ha!)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they schnied
I'm crying

Semolina Pilchard 
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should've seen them kicking
Edgar Allan Poe

I am the Eggman (whoo!)
They are the Eggmen (whoo!)
I am the Walrus (whoo!)
Goo goo g'joob, goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob, goo goo g'joob, goob
