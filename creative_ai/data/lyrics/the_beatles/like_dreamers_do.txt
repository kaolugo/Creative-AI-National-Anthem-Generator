I, I saw a girl in my dreams,
And so it seems
That I will love her.

Oh, you, you are that girl in my dreams,
And so it seems
That I will love you.

And I, I, I, I, I,
Waited for your kiss,
Waited for the bliss,
Like dreamers do.

And I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Oh, I'll be there, yeah,
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you, you,

You came just one dream ago,
And now I know
That I will love you.

I knew when you first said hello,
That's how I know
That I will love you.

And I, I, I, I,
Waited for your kiss,
Waited for the bliss,
Like dreamers do.

And I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Oh, I'll be there, yeah,
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you, you,

You came just one dream ago,
And now I know
That I will love you.

Oh, I knew when you first said hello,
That's how I know
That I will love you.

And I, I, I, I,
Waited for your kiss,
Waited for the bliss,
Like dreamers do.
Oh, like dreamers do,
Like dreamers do.
