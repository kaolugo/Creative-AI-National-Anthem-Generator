Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
It's not always been this gray

All things must pass
All things must pass away

Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this, my love is up and must be leaving
It's not always been this gray

All things must pass
All things must pass away

All things must pass
None of life's dreams can last
So, I must be on my way
To face another day

Now darkness only stays the nighttime
In the morning, it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
It's not always gonna be this gray

All things must pass
All things must pass away

All things must pass
All things must pass away
