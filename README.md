# Creative AI - National Anthem Generator Project

Welcome to the Creative AI - National Anthem Generator Repository! **Creative AI** is about using artificial intelligence to automatically generate lyrics and music using datasets of your choice.

For my rendition of the Creative AI project, I developed an artificial intelligence that can generate "new" national anthem music using over 140 already existing national anthem data files.

This artificial intelligence can generate wav files containing the new national anthems.

Here is a link to a demo of music generated by this project. Clicking the link below will lead you to a Google Slides presentation with randomly generated flags to go along with the generated national anthems. Click the speaker button at the bottom left corner of each slide to listen to a demo.

Here are a few notes:

* Don't touch the \_\_init\_\_.py files. These are necessary to your project.

* Things will be easier if you read the spec first and follow the given function order.

* Make sure you have `pip` installed so you can download pysynth, pydub, and numpy.
